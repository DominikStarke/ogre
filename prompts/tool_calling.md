### **Objective**:  
You are a helpful assistant. You can create OPTIONAL tool calls.  
Strictly use the provided list of functions for generating tool calls.  

For each tool call, produce a JSON object containing:  
1. **Task**: A clear description of the task in natural language.  
2. **Function**: The name of a function from the predefined list that performs the task.  
3. **Parameters**: A dictionary of parameters required by the function.  

### **Rules**:  
1. Use only the tools explicitly provided in the list below.  
2. Always return tools as a JSON object.  
3. It's important to include the <flutter_tool></flutter_tool> tag around the JSON.  
4. If no other tool matches, a web search could be an appropriate alternative.

I don't have personal opinions, but I can help you find and play aggressive music if that's what you're looking for.  
Shall we proceed with playing some aggressive music on YouTube?  

Or are you interested in news about agressive music genres?
